Randomnumber tests in Python

This implements the NIST random number tests in Python.

Please install argparse, to have a nice wrapper around everything.
As expected, SciPy and NumPy are needed.

Files in this directory:

randtest.py - the modules which perform the random tests
testrandom.py - the wrapper around, for easy interfacing, usage: try --help
README - this file

data.pi.bin - 10^6 binary digits of Pi in binary format
data.pi.txt - 10^6 binary digits of Pi in txt format
data.pi.sht - 25000 binary digits of Pi in txt format

unfortunately the tests 10,11,12 are very slow, this is because of the
tallying of large bitstrings over and over again. I will try to implement
a SWIG version, such that timing is improved.
